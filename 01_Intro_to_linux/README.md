# Khanlab Tutorial 1: Accessing Linux & Compute Canada Data

## Objective:

Review the available options for connecting to linux systems, and best practices for organizing and accessing your data on Compute Canada

## Prerequisites (Homework! Do this on your own before the tutorial): 

* Obtain a compute Canada account (see https://osf.io/4u5jr/wiki/Compute%20Canada/ - ask your supervisor for a CCRI)

* Depending on OS, install:
  * Windows Users: 
    * Install Linux sub-system
    * Add link to most relevant tutorial here
  * Mac Users: 
    * XQuartz (X11), iTerm2 (a better terminal app)
    * Add link to tutorial(s) here -- 
  * Linux Users:
    * Use system terminal (https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners)


* Accessing your data remotely
  * Windows Users:
    * Install WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
  * Mac Users: 
    * Install SSHFS (https://www.sharcnet.ca/help/index.php/SSHFS)
  * Linux Users:
    * Install SSHFS (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware#installing-a-package)
  * All Users:
    * Install Globus Connect Personal client (https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal  -OR- https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i7hs44qn87ph6nv/AAAUctO_4DjGp4TfF4LuIvfxa?dl=0)
