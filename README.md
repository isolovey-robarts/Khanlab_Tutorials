		Run a singularity image on Compute Canada

	• Testing and continuous integration

## Current thoughts 

* Have the tutorials done on Friday mornings (9.30 to 12) starting at the beginning of September. 

* Each tutorial takes around 2 hours with a 10 minute break during the 2 hours.

* Must have a tutorial outline and sample data/task for everyone to work on.

* Tutorials will be recored and will make available for new students.
