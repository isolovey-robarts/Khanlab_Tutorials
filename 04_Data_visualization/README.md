# Khanlab Tutorial 4: Data visualization

## Objective:
Learn about a number of visualization tools and how to use them including ITKSnap, FSLeyes, Slicer, and Paraview!

## Prerequisites (Homework! Do this on your own before the tutorial):
* Download and install the latest version of [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) on your system
* Download and install the latest version of [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/) on your system
* Download and install the latest version of [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Downloads.SNAP3) on your system

## At the end of this tutorial, you will know:

### Paraview
* Visualize neuroimaging models & data on Paraview.
* Create multiple renderers to view / compare data
* Shortcuts & filters for manipulating loaded data
* View / create animations via paraview (great for visualizing tractography)

## Tasks:

### Paraview
* Check on prerequisite (installation)
* Demo paraview
* Multiple render windows
* Animations

## Data:

### Paraview
* N/A

## Notes:
* Paraview can also perform other analyis (eg. finite-element modelling)

## Resources:
* Sharcnet Webinar on Paraview (2017): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yexB3W2FYM0
    * Good resource for learning about the extensive capabilities of paraview
